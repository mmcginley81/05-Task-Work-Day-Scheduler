# 05-Task-Work-Day-Scheduler

Workday Scheduler will use local storage to save and locate items while also using JQuery and Bootstrap to format the layout of the website and it's icons.Â 

The application is a way to clearly layout your day and see what you have to do during the day and at what time.

I did not have too much trouble with this assignment, except I worked off the starter code and needed to create a new repository and put my final assignment files inside.
